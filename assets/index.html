                    Motor vehicles have been identified as the most dominant source of a plethora of air pollutants
                    in cities. Stuck in slow-moving traffic, vehicles spend more time on the road, idling, crawling, and
                    undergoing many stop-go events that inevitably leads to an increase in<br> emissions. The burning of
                    fuel creates
                    numerous harmful byproducts, all having a damaging effect on the<br>health of humans, animals, and
                    the
                    local vegetation.

                        Ekospati is a holistic solution that utilizes technology to monitor the condition of cities in
                        real-time. The application not only provides up-to-date information on population, industry,
                        pollution levels, and air quality, but it also provides city planning recommendations based on
                        accurate data. For example, if a city faces a high risk of pollution due to industrial boom,
                        EkoSpati can provide solutions such as arranging industries in more remote areas or increasing
                        green areas.
